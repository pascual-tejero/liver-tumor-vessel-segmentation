# TACE Project
This repository holds the code for the TACE (Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization) project, a collaborative effort by the Technical University of Munich (TUM) as part of the Computational Surgineering course. 

The objective of this project is to improve the visualization during the TACE procedure. Sometimes it is difficult to have a complete understanding of the patient's vessel, liver, and tumor structure, which can cause multiple problems for the patient and surgeon. We hope this project will be useful for doctors and surgeons in improving the TACE procedure and providing better outcomes for patients.

## Project Members
The TACE project was completed by the following project members:

1. Natalia Avendaño Prieto
2. Jorge Padilla Pérez
3. Pascual Tejero Cervera

## Liver and Tumor Segmentation
Natalia and Pascual focused on the segmentation of liver and tumor. Natalia adapted the code of TransUNet, while Pascual modified the code of KiU-Net. Both Natalia and Pascual changed and adapted the code for the specific task of liver and tumor segmentation. More information about their work can be found in the specific folders.

## Vessel Segmentation
Jorge readapted the code for the task of vessel segmentation with the neural network called APAUnet. More information about his work can be found in the respective folder.
